Project to modify OTTER designed in CPE-233 to play music stored in memory
This was my final project for CPE-233 Professor Callenes. I collaborated with Jack Kramer and Anderson MacMillan to complete this project
I was responsible for writing the code that would run on the OTTER, creating the SPI module to drive the DAC and compile the memory containing the song data.
